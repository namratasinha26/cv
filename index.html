        <p><em>Founder of <a href="https://lifestylenama.com/">LifestyleNama</a></em></p>
        <p>I’m Namrata Sinha and this is my happy place where I share all things from lifestyle, travel, beauty, health & wellness to blogging related stuff. I’m a lifestyle blogger who loves writing, traveling, thinking, eating, and taking pictures.
          I
          quit my job in 2016 and have been traveling slowly and exploring various parts of India and other countries with my travel buddy (my husband). I created this blog because I needed a break from 9 to 5 jobs and wanted to explore the new way
          of
          living. I’m one of those blessed people who can deliver their work while exploring the amazing places out there. I love traveling more than anything and I believe traveling is not only visiting monuments but it’s more than that. It helps us
          in
          learning about the culture, interacting with new people, trying new cuisine, and much more. The things we learn can change the perspective of our life. I consider myself a banjara (Nomad) and I would love to live my life as a Digital Nomad.
